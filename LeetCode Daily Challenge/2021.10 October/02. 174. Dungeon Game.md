# 02. 174. Dungeon Game

## LOGIC
- Evaluate a path: `[2, -13, 3, -5]`
    - find the initial health
    - the final health has to be 1
    - let's start from the end?
    - required health from the end to the start
        - 1--5 = 6
        - 6-3 = 3
        - 3--13 = 16
        - 16-2 = 14
        - ans = 14
- Find the best path
    - Enumerate all the paths
    - Evaluate all the paths
    - `dfs(x, y): return required_health`
        - start from: `dfs(0, 0)`
        - base: `(x, y) == (m-1, n-1)`
        - spawns off: `dfs(x+1, y)` and `dfs(x, y+1)`

## Recursive DFS Code
```python3
class Solution:
    def calculateMinimumHP(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(x, y):
            if x >= m or y >= n: return inf
            
            if (x, y) == (m-1, n-1):
                req = -grid[x][y]
                return 1 if req <= 0 else req+1
            
            req = min(dfs(x+1, y), dfs(x, y+1))    
            req -= grid[x][y]
            
            return 1 if req <= 0 else req

        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        return dfs(0, 0)
```

## Iterative DP Code

Iterative dp is mostly a translation of the recursive code. There's the edge case that needs to be handled.
- Recall how we had "walls" for the dfs, saying that we need inf health required
- In this case, we have to do the same
- Except for one place where `dp[m][n-1] = dp[m-1][n] = 1`
- This is because of the case of `(x, y) = (m-1, n-1)`, where we try to access `dp[x+1][y]` and `dp[x][y+1]` and take their minimum
- Thus, the line `dp[m][n-1] = dp[m-1][n] = 1` becomes the base case

```python3
class Solution:
    def calculateMinimumHP(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        dp = [[inf]*(n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]
        dp[m][n-1] = dp[m-1][n] = 1
        
        for x in reversed(range(m)):
            for y in reversed(range(n)):
                dp[x][y] = min(dp[x+1][y], dp[x][y+1])
                dp[x][y] -= grid[x][y]
                dp[x][y] = 1 if dp[x][y] <= 0 else dp[x][y]
            
        return dp[0][0]
```
