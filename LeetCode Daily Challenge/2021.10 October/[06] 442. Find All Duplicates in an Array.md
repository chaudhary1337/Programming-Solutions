# [06] 442. Find All Duplicates in an Array

## General
- We have to get a solution for O(N) time O(1) space
- We have multiple solutions that take either more time or more space
- But there's one method which can get us the answer

## Logic
- observe the range of elements `[1, n]` this means we can do operations *inside* the array
- we need a way to mark and say if an element has been visited or not
- we need a consisitent way to always land up at the same index, for the same element
- what we can do is:
    - for the element `x`
    - visit the index `x-1` (since elements are 1 indexed)
    - and change the value `y` at the index `x-1` to `-y`
    - while iterating, if some element `z`'s pointed element (`nums[z-1]`) is -ve
    - then the value `z` has been repeated twice 
    - once to set `y` to `-y` and once right now

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        ans = []
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
            x = nums[i]
            if nums[abs(x)-1] < 0: ans.append(abs(x))
            else: nums[abs(x)-1] *= -1
        return ans
```
