# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

## Logic
- Each character is either a part of the answer OR it is not
- Have two pointers i, j pointing to s and t respectively
- if `s[i] == t[j]`, we have a match, thus its a good idea to include this character
- if not, we try skipping over the character in `s` by doing `i+1` or do skip over character in `t` by doing `j+1`
- we don't know which is the better case, so we spawn a recursion in both cases and store the max(case1, case2)
- Iterative solution is just a translation of the recursive logic

## Recursive Solution
```python3
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:

        @lru_cache(None)
        def recurse(i, j):
            if i >= m or j >= n: return 0
            
            if s[i] == t[j]: return 1 + recurse(i+1, j+1)
        
            return max(recurse(i+1, j), recurse(i, j+1))
        
        m, n = len(s), len(t)
        return recurse(0, 0)
```


## Iterative Solution
```python3
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        m, n = len(s), len(t)
        dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)] 
        for i in reversed(range(m)):
            for j in reversed(range(n)):
                if s[i] == t[j]: dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i+1][j+1]
                else: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1])
                    
        return dp[0][0]
```
