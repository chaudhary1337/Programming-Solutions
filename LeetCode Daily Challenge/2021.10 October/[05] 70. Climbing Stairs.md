# [05] 70. Climbing Stairs

## Iterative DP

```python3
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0]*(n+1)
        
        dp[0] = dp[1] = 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            dp[i] = dp[i-1]+dp[i-2]
        
        return dp[n]
```

- Time: O(N)
- Space: O(N)

## Space Optimizations
We only look at the last two values for computing ith value. Instead of an array, we can just keep 'a' and 'b' variables to compute 'c'.

```python3
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        a = 1
        b = 1
        c = a + b
        for _ in range(n-2): # n-2 because first two have already been completed
            a = b
            b = c
            c = a + b

        return c
```
